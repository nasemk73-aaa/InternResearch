# Embedded Finance Components - Agent Instructions

Monorepo containing React component library for embedded banking solutions. Active development focuses on `embedded-components` package.

## Package Manager

- **Yarn** (workspaces)

## Quick Start

See [Setup Guide](docs/setup.md) for installation and development commands.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Architecture Patterns

**All code generation MUST follow patterns in `embedded-components/ARCHITECTURE.md`.**

Before generating component code, review the architecture document for:

- Component structure and file organization
- Import patterns (no aggregation barrels)
- Type colocation rules
- Code organization decision tree

## Documentation

- **[Setup & Commands](docs/setup.md)** - Installation, build, and development commands
- **[Code Quality Workflow](docs/code-quality-workflow.md)** - Mandatory test-fix-verify process
- **[Testing Guidelines](docs/testing-guidelines.md)** - Test patterns, coverage, MSW setup
- **[TypeScript Conventions](docs/typescript-conventions.md)** - Type safety, patterns, best practices
- **[Component Implementation](docs/component-implementation.md)** - React patterns, hooks, styling
- **[Git Workflow](docs/git-workflow.md)** - Commit conventions and branching

## Package-Specific Instructions

- **embedded-components**: See `embedded-components/AGENTS.md` for package-specific details
- **app/client-next-ts**: See `app/client-next-ts/AGENTS.md` for app-specific patterns (Tailwind prefix rules, drawer pattern, MSW override architecture, `@visual-json/react` integration)
  - **Current showcase website**: Modern React application demonstrating embedded finance components
  - **Technology**: Vite, React 18, TypeScript, TanStack Router, shadcn/ui, Playwright, MSW
  - **Main demo**: SellSense marketplace demo at `/sellsense-demo` route
  - **Features**: Multiple theme support (SellSense, PayFicient, etc.), content tokens for tone variants
  - **Key docs**: `app/client-next-ts/PRD.md` (product requirements), `app/client-next-ts/MSW_SETUP.md` (API mocking setup)
  - **Note**: This app **consumes** embedded-components. Component development happens in `embedded-components/`.
  - **Code quality**: `npm test` · `npm run format:check` / `npm run format` · `npm run health-check`
- **app/client**: Legacy/archived showcase (minimal content, not actively maintained)
- **app/server**: Express server for proxying requests to J.P. Morgan Sandbox/UAT APIs (sandbox uses OAuth2, UAT uses certificate authentication)
- **app/server-session-transfer**: Demo application for partially hosted onboarding integration pattern

## Agent Skills

Agent Skills provide specialized guidance for specific tasks. **Always reference relevant skills when working on related tasks.** Skills are located in `.github/skills/` and are automatically loaded by GitHub Copilot and other AI agents. **Cursor users:** create a local symlink `.cursor` → `.github` so Cursor finds the same content.

1. **[embedded-banking-architecture](.github/skills/embedded-banking-architecture/)** - Core architecture patterns, component structure, and organization principles. **MUST review before creating any component code.**

   - Use when: Creating new components, organizing code structure, following 2025 React/TypeScript patterns
   - See: `.github/skills/embedded-banking-architecture/AGENTS.md` for complete documentation

2. **[component-testing](.github/skills/component-testing/)** - Comprehensive testing patterns with MSW, React Query, and Vitest. **Required for all components (80% coverage minimum).**

   - Use when: Writing tests, setting up mocks, testing API interactions, ensuring coverage
   - See: `.github/skills/component-testing/AGENTS.md` for complete documentation

3. **[code-quality-workflow](.github/skills/code-quality-workflow/)** - Mandatory workflow that must run after ANY code changes. **CRITICAL: Run before every commit.** For large changes, also run build: `yarn format`, `yarn typecheck`, `yarn build`, `yarn test`.

   - Use when: After creating/editing files, before commits, when fixing errors
   - See: `.github/skills/code-quality-workflow/AGENTS.md` for complete documentation

4. **[styling-guidelines](.github/skills/styling-guidelines/)** - Tailwind CSS patterns with mandatory `eb-` prefix. **ALL Tailwind classes MUST use `eb-` prefix.**

   - Use when: Applying styles, creating UI, working with design tokens
   - See: `.github/skills/styling-guidelines/AGENTS.md` for complete documentation

5. **[react-patterns](.github/skills/react-patterns/)** - React 18 patterns, hooks best practices, component composition, and optimization techniques.

   - Use when: Creating hooks, optimizing performance, following React patterns
   - See: `.github/skills/react-patterns/AGENTS.md` for complete documentation

6. **[i18n-l10n](.github/skills/i18n-l10n/)** - Internationalization and localization patterns for multi-locale support (en-US, fr-CA, es-US).

   - Use when: Implementing translations, formatting dates/numbers/currency, handling locale-specific content
   - See: `.github/skills/i18n-l10n/AGENTS.md` for complete documentation

7. **[windows-powershell](.github/skills/windows-powershell/)** - Windows PowerShell command patterns. **CRITICAL: NEVER use `&&` in PowerShell, use `;` instead.**

   - Use when: Running commands, scripts, or terminal operations on Windows
   - See: `.github/skills/windows-powershell/AGENTS.md` for complete documentation

8. **[test-and-fix-workflow](.github/skills/test-and-fix-workflow/)** - Automated workflow for running tests and fixing failures systematically.

   - Use when: Implementing the mandatory test workflow, fixing code quality issues
   - See: `.github/skills/test-and-fix-workflow/AGENTS.md` for complete documentation

9. **[vercel-react-best-practices](.github/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/)** - React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering.

   - See: `.github/skills/vercel-react-best-practices/AGENTS.md` for complete documentation (45 rules across 8 categories)

### How to Use Skills

Each skill contains:

- **`SKILL.md`** - Summary with frontmatter, quick reference, and links to detailed documentation
- **`AGENTS.md`** - Complete detailed documentation for agents and LLMs
- **`rules/`** directory (where applicable) - Individual rule files for specific patterns

**When working on a task:**

1. Identify which skills are relevant to your task
2. Review the `SKILL.md` for quick reference
3. Consult `AGENTS.md` for detailed instructions and examples
4. Follow the patterns and guidelines provided

**Skills are automatically loaded by GitHub Copilot** from `.github/skills/`. Cursor: use a local `.cursor` → `.github` symlink. Explicitly reference skills in your prompts for best results.
