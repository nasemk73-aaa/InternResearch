# AGENTS.md

GROWI is a team collaboration wiki platform built with Next.js, Express, and MongoDB. This guide provides essential instructions for AI coding agents working with the GROWI codebase.

## Language Policy

**Response Language**: If the user writes in a non-English language at any point in the conversation, always respond in that language from that point onward. This rule takes **absolute priority** over any other language instructions, including skill/command prompts or context documents written in English.

**Code Comments**: When generating source code, all comments and explanations within the code must be written in English, regardless of the conversation language.

## Project Overview

GROWI is a team collaboration wiki platform using Markdown, featuring hierarchical page organization, real-time collaborative editing, authentication integrations, and plugin support. Built as a monorepo with Next.js, Express, and MongoDB.

### Package-Specific CLAUDE.md

Each application has its own CLAUDE.md with detailed instructions:

- `apps/app/CLAUDE.md` - Main GROWI application
- `apps/pdf-converter/CLAUDE.md` - PDF conversion microservice
- `apps/slackbot-proxy/CLAUDE.md` - Slack integration proxy

### Serena Memories

Additional detailed specifications are stored in **Serena memories** and can be referenced when needed for specific features or subsystems.

## Quick Reference

### Essential Commands (Global)

```bash
# Development
turbo run dev                    # Start all dev servers

# Quality Checks (use Turborepo for caching)
turbo run lint --filter @growi/app
turbo run test --filter @growi/app

# Production
pnpm run app:build              # Build main app
pnpm start                      # Build and start
```

```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Feature-Based Architecture**: Create new features in `features/{feature-name}/`
2. **Server-Client Separation**: Keep server and client code separate
3. **State Management**: Jotai for UI state, SWR for data fetching
4. **Named Exports**: Prefer named exports (except Next.js pages)
5. **Test Co-location**: Place test files next to source files
6. **Type Safety**: Use strict TypeScript throughout
7. **Changeset**: Use `npx changeset` for version management

## Before Committing

Always execute these checks:

```bash
# From workspace root (recommended)
turbo run lint --filter @growi/app
turbo run test --filter @growi/app
turbo run build --filter @growi/app
```

Or from apps/app directory:

```bash
pnpm run lint
pnpm run test
pnpm run build
```
