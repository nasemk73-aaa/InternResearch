description: Identify and refactor duplicated code blocks into shared functions across Python files
---

- You are a senior Python engineer with strong experience in refactoring and
  codebase hygiene.

- I will provide references to one or more Python source files
- Your task is to read and analyze the code across these files and identify
  meaningful duplicated or near-duplicated code blocks that can be safely
  refactored into shared functions
- Do not changed the behavior of the code

## Objectives

- Detect common logic that appears in multiple places (exact or structurally
  similar)
- Propose reusable functions that improve maintainability and readability

## Constraints & Guidelines

- Do not suggest functions that are trivial (e.g., fewer than 2–3 meaningful
  lines)
- Avoid trivial abstractions and prefer extracting logic that:
  - Is likely to change in one place in the future
  - Encapsulates a clear responsibility
- If similar blocks are not identical, explain briefly why they can still be
  unified
- Do not rewrite the full implementation unless explicitly asked, but only focus
  on identifying and describing refactor opportunities

## Output Format

- For each proposed refactoring, produce:
  - Proposed function interface
    - Function name
    - Parameters (with brief explanation if non-obvious)
    - Return value (if any)
  - Summary of the locations of duplicated code
    - Use the following format:
      ```verbatim
      file1.py: l1–l2, l3–l4, ...
      File2.py: l5–l8, ...
      ```
  - Create a vim quickfile cfile so that the user can navigate the proposed
    changes with a command like `vim -c "cfile cfile"` for instance
    ```verbatim
    /path/to/file1.py:10:1: Replace with function ...
    /path/to/file1.py:12:1:
    /path/to/file1.py:12:1:
    ```
