description: Move test classes from a test file into the correct separate test files based on what they test
---

- I will pass you a file with unit tests test_file.py

## Step 1

- Find the functions that are tested in the file `test_file.py`
- Prepare a plan that shows a mapping between test classes and file that
  contains the functions tested by each class

## Step 2

- Implement this plan
  - Using the --append option in `split_in_files.py`
  - Not preserving the input file so it's an actual move of code from one file
    to another

- Modify `test_file.py` to move the code to the right direction

- Write the `split_in_files.py` command
