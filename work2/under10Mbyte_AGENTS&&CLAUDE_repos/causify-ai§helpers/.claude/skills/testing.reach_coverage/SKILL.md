description: Increase unit test coverage toward 100 percent for a given function or file following a plan-then-implement workflow
---

Given the passed file or the function increase unit test coverage to approach 100
percent

# Step 1: Establish Current Coverage

- Identify the test file corresponding to the target function
  - Example:
    ```
    helpers/hllm_cli.py -> helpers/test/test_hllm_cli.py
    ```
- Run the following command and record the results:
  ```
  > pytest --cov=yourpkg --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
  ```

- Summarize which lines and branches are not covered.

# Step 2: Design a Testing Plan

- Analyze uncovered code paths and behaviors.
- Propose a clear testing plan that:
  - Tests functions modularly before testing interactions.
  - Prioritizes end-to-end and user-visible behavior over incidental
    implementation details.
  - Avoids testing assertions, defensive checks, or invalid inputs unless they
    are critical to correctness.
- Explicitly map each uncovered area to one or more proposed tests.

# Step 3: Specify Tests Without Implementation

- Define test classes and test method names.
- For each proposed test:
  - Describe the input data.
  - Describe the expected output or observable behavior.
- Do not write executable test code at this stage.

# Step 4: Implement After Approval

- Wait for user confirmation or feedback on the testing plan.
- After approval:
  - Implement the tests according to the approved plan.
  - Re-run coverage and verify that coverage for the target function is near 100
    percent.
  - Report final coverage results and remaining gaps, if any.

# Important Rules

- Do not implement tests before the plan is approved.
- Do not proceed if instructions or requirements are ambiguous.
- Always adhere to the formatting and style guides referenced above.
- Focus on meaningful behavior and correctness rather than superficial
  coverage.
- All tests and code must strictly follow:
  - @.claude/skills/coding.format_rules/SKILL.md for any Python code
  - @.claude/skills/testing.format_rules/SKILL.md for tests
- If any part of the task is unclear or underspecified, stop and ask for
  clarification before proceeding.
