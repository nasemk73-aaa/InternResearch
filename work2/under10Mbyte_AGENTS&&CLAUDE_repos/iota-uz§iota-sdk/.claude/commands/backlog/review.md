You are tasked with reviewing backlog items to verify implementation quality and completeness. All available backlog items:

!`ls -1 .claude/backlog/*.md 2>&1 | sort -n`

If no files are found, stop and inform the user.

## Step 1: Initialize Review

Prepare to track the completion status for each backlog item. You will review each item sequentially using the auditor agent.

## Step 2: Sequential Review Process

For each backlog file in numeric order:

1. Read the file contents using the Read tool
2. Extract the agent type from `[agent:TYPE]` (first line)
3. Extract the task prompt (all lines after the first line)
4. Launch the `auditor` agent using the Task tool with this prompt:

```
Review the implementation for the following task and determine:

1. Code quality: Is the code well-structured, maintainable, and following best practices?
2. Completeness: Are all requirements from the task fully implemented?
3. Implementation status: Is this task FULLY COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE?

Task context:
{TASK_PROMPT}

Provide your assessment focusing on:
- What was implemented (if anything)
- Quality of the implementation
- Missing functionality or requirements
- Final verdict: COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE

If you cannot find relevant implementation or the task appears not to have been started, mark as INCOMPLETE.
```

5. Wait for the agent to complete before proceeding to the next item
6. Track the filename and completion status based on agent feedback
7. **DO NOT delete files during this step** - only collect completion status

## Step 3: Present Complete Items

After reviewing all items, compile a list of items that the auditor agent marked as COMPLETE.

If no items are complete, inform the user and exit.

If items are complete, present them to the user in this format:

```
Review complete. The following items are fully implemented:

001-add-promocode-column-to-policies.md
- Status: COMPLETE
- Summary: [brief summary from agent feedback]

002-fix-graphql-null-pointer-errors.md
- Status: COMPLETE
- Summary: [brief summary from agent feedback]
```

## Step 4: Confirm Deletion

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask which complete items should be deleted:

- **Question:** "Which complete backlog items would you like to delete?"
- **Header:** "Delete items"
- **Options:** List each COMPLETE filename as an option with its summary as description
- **multiSelect:** true

## Step 5: Delete Confirmed Items

After receiving user selection:

1. Confirm: "Deleting {COUNT} items: {FILENAMES}"
2. Delete each selected file using rm command: `rm .claude/backlog/{FILENAME}`
3. Provide summary:

```
Deleted: {COUNT} items
Remaining backlog items: {COUNT}
```

If remaining items exist, list them.

## Important Notes

- Execute reviews sequentially (one after another), NOT in parallel
- Wait for each auditor agent to complete before moving to the next item
- Track completion status from agent feedback - look for a clear COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE verdict
- Only suggest deletion for items marked COMPLETE by the agent
- Use Bash tool with rm command to delete files
- Do NOT renumber remaining files (unlike delete.md, this preserves the original numbering)
