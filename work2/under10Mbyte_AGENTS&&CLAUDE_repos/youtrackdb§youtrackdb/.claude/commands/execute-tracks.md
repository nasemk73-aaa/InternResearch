Read and follow the workflow for Phase 3 (Execution).

Read these workflow documents in order before starting:
1. `.claude/workflow/conventions.md` — shared formats,
   glossary, plan file structure, scope indicators, review iteration protocol
2. `.claude/workflow/conventions-execution.md` — execution-specific:
   episode formats, commit format, code review, complexity tiers,
   checklist decomposition rules, step file content
3. `.claude/workflow/workflow.md` — session lifecycle,
   startup protocol (auto-resume), strategy refresh, cross-track impact
   monitoring, session boundary rules, failure handling, inline replanning
   (ESCALATE), track completion protocol

After determining which phase to execute, load the phase-specific document:
- Phase A: `.claude/workflow/track-review.md`
- Phase B: `.claude/workflow/step-implementation.md`
- Phase C: `.claude/workflow/track-code-review.md`

Do NOT load phase documents you won't use this session. Prompt files
(in `.claude/workflow/prompts/`) are read only when spawning the specific
sub-agent that needs them — do not pre-load them into the main session.

On-demand reference documents (load only when the situation arises):
- `strategy-refresh.md` — load when entering State A (strategy refresh)
- `inline-replanning.md` — load when ESCALATE triggers
- `episode-format-reference.md` — load when writing your first episode
- `design-document-rules.md` — not needed during Phase 3

Plan directory name: if "$ARGUMENTS" is non-empty, use it as the directory
name. Otherwise, default to the current git branch name
(`git branch --show-current`).

The implementation plan is at: docs/adr/<dir-name>/implementation-plan.md

Follow the startup protocol in `workflow.md`:

1. Read the plan file at `docs/adr/<dir-name>/implementation-plan.md`.
2. Identify all tracks and their status (`[ ]` not started, `[x]` completed,
   `[~]` skipped).
3. Determine session state and auto-resume:
   - **State A** (track just completed, needs strategy refresh): perform
     strategy refresh, then proceed to Phase A of the next track.
   - **State B** (fresh start): identify first uncompleted track, begin
     Phase A (review + decomposition).
   - **State C** (mid-track resume): read step file Progress section,
     resume the next incomplete phase:
     - `Review + decomposition` incomplete → resume Phase A
     - Steps incomplete → run Phase B (check for orphan commits from
       interrupted steps — see step-implementation.md §Phase B Resume)
     - Steps done, code review incomplete → run Phase C
     - All phases done → compile track episode, present to user, write
       to plan file only after user approval
4. Inform the user of the auto-resume decision. The user can override, but
   by default proceed without waiting for confirmation.
5. Load the phase-specific workflow document and execute that phase only.
6. After the phase completes, end the session. Instruct the user to clear
   context and re-run `/execute-tracks` for the next phase.

Each session handles exactly ONE PHASE of one track:
- Phase A → end session
- Phase B → end session (or mid-phase checkpoint if 5+ steps done)
- Phase C → end session
- Track completion → end session after user approval

User interaction happens at specific points:
- Session start: auto-resume decision (confirm or override)
- Strategy refresh: accept recommendation or override
- Phase complete: user clears session, re-runs `/execute-tracks`
- Cross-track impact detected: continue, pause, or escalate
- Track complete: approve, request fixes, or request rework
- Step failure (2nd attempt): retry, adjust, or escalate

Everything within a phase executes autonomously: Phase A runs reviews (as
sub-agents) and decomposes steps; Phase B implements steps with dimensional
review iterations (ten review sub-agents in parallel) and episode
production; Phase C runs track-level dimensional review (ten sub-agents).
