Read and follow the workflow for Phase 2 (Implementation Review).

Read these workflow documents in order before starting:
1. `.claude/workflow/conventions.md` — shared formats,
   glossary, plan file structure, scope indicators, review iteration protocol
2. `.claude/workflow/implementation-review.md` — Phase 2 orchestration:
   two-step review (consistency review then automatic structural review)

You are the Implementation Review Orchestrator. Your job is to validate
the plan's consistency with the codebase and design document, then validate
its structural quality — all before execution begins.

Plan directory name: if "$ARGUMENTS" is non-empty, use it as the directory
name. Otherwise, default to the current git branch name
(`git branch --show-current`).

Plan file: docs/adr/<dir-name>/implementation-plan.md
Design document: docs/adr/<dir-name>/design.md
Review output directory: docs/adr/<dir-name>/reviews/

## Step 1: Consistency Review (interactive)

1. Read the plan file, the design document, and the workflow documents.
   Also consult `planning.md` §Architecture Notes format and
   `design-document-rules.md` for the rules the review validates against.
2. Spawn the consistency review sub-agent with the prompt from
   `.claude/workflow/prompts/consistency-review.md`. Pass the plan file,
   design document path, and workflow directory path so the sub-agent can
   read code and verify references.
3. Receive the findings report.
4. Present findings to the user grouped by severity (blocker → should-fix
   → suggestion). For each finding, show:
   - The issue and evidence from the code
   - The proposed fix
   - Your recommendation (accept/modify/reject) with reasoning
5. Wait for the user's decision on each finding.
6. Apply accepted fixes to the plan file and/or design document.
7. Spawn the consistency gate verification sub-agent with:
   - The previous findings list
   - The updated plan and design document
   - Instructions to verify fixes and flag regressions
8. If the gate finds new blockers, present them and loop (max 3 iterations).
   If fixes significantly restructure the plan or design document
   (tracks reordered, classes/flows redesigned, scope indicators changed
   substantially), re-run the full consistency review instead of the gate.
9. When the gate is clean, save the review document to
   docs/adr/<dir-name>/reviews/consistency.md.

Finding IDs are cumulative across iterations (CR1, CR2, ... CR6, CR7).

## Step 2: Structural Review (automatic)

After consistency review passes, proceed **automatically** to structural
review without waiting for user confirmation.

10. Spawn the structural review sub-agent with the prompt from
    `.claude/workflow/prompts/structural-review.md`. Pass the workflow
    directory path and the design document path.
11. Receive the findings report.
12. **If no blockers**: save the review document to
    docs/adr/<dir-name>/reviews/structural.md and proceed to completion.
13. **If blockers found**: present findings to the user grouped by severity.
    For each finding, show:
    - The issue
    - The proposed fix
    - Your recommendation (accept/modify/reject) with reasoning
14. Wait for the user's decision on each finding.
15. Apply accepted fixes.
16. Spawn the gate verification sub-agent.
17. If the gate finds new blockers, present them and loop (max 3 iterations).
    If fixes significantly restructured the plan (tracks reordered,
    tracks added/removed, scope indicators changed substantially), re-run
    the full structural review instead of the gate.
18. When the gate is clean, save the review document to
    docs/adr/<dir-name>/reviews/structural.md.

Finding IDs are cumulative across iterations (S1, S2, ... S6, S7).

## Completion

When both reviews pass:
19. Summarize all changes made to the plan and design document.
20. Confirm the plan is ready for Phase 3 — the user can invoke
    `/execute-tracks` to begin implementation. Remind the user that
    technical/risk/adversarial reviews will happen per-track during execution.
