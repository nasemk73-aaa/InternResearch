# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance for AI coding agents working on the Spirit codebase.

## Project Overview

Spirit is an **online schema change tool for MySQL 8.0+**, reimplementing [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost). It applies `ALTER TABLE` statements to large tables without blocking reads or writes by creating a shadow copy, streaming binlog changes, and performing an atomic cutover via `RENAME TABLE`.

Spirit is designed for **speed** — it is multi-threaded in both row-copying and binlog-applying phases. The internal goal is to migrate a 10 TiB table in under 5 days. It has been demonstrated on a real 10 TiB table in ~65 hours.

**Key tradeoffs vs gh-ost:**
- Only supports MySQL 8.0+
- Does not support keeping read replicas within <10s lag
- Targets AWS Aurora environments (InnoDB only, no read-replica fidelity)

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build the spirit binary
cd cmd/spirit && go build

# Run a schema change
./spirit migrate --host=<host> --username=<user> --password=<pass> --database=<db> --table=<table> --alter="<alter statement>"

# Other subcommands
./spirit move --help
./spirit lint --help
./spirit diff --help
```

Spirit uses [Kong](https://github.com/alecthomas/kong) for CLI argument parsing with subcommands. The CLI structs are defined in `pkg/migration/`, `pkg/move/`, and `pkg/lint/` respectively.

## Requirements

- **Go 1.26+**
- **MySQL 8.0+** for running tests and performing schema changes
- **golangci-lint v2** for linting

## Testing

Tests require a running MySQL server. Provide the DSN via environment variable:

```bash
MYSQL_DSN="root:mypassword@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/test" go test -v ./...
```

If `MYSQL_DSN` is not set, it defaults to `spirit:spirit@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/test`.

### Running tests with Docker

```bash
cd compose/
docker compose down --volumes && docker compose up -f compose.yml -f 8.0.28.yml
docker compose up mysql test --abort-on-container-exit
```

### Test utilities

The `pkg/testutils/` package provides helpers used across all test files:

- `DSN()` / `DSNForDatabase(dbName)` — returns the MySQL DSN from the environment or default
- `CreateUniqueTestDatabase(t)` — creates a unique temporary database with automatic cleanup via `t.Cleanup()`
- `RunSQL(t, stmt)` / `RunSQLInDatabase(t, dbName, stmt)` — execute SQL against the test MySQL
- `IsMinimalRBRTestRunner(t)` — detects minimal `binlog_row_image` environments to skip incompatible tests

**Test patterns used in this project:**
- Most tests use `RunSQL(t, stmt)` with `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` in the default `test` database. This is simple and sufficient for tests that don't interfere with each other.
- Use `CreateUniqueTestDatabase(t)` only for integration tests that run concurrent migrations or need full database isolation (e.g., tests in `pkg/migration/`).
- Integration tests connect to real MySQL — there are no mocked database tests for core logic
- The `table` package provides a `MockChunker` for testing copier/applier without real chunking
- Test files live alongside their source files (e.g., `single_target.go` / `single_target_test.go`)

## Linting

```bash
golangci-lint run
```

The project uses golangci-lint v2 with `gofmt` and `goimports` formatters enabled (see `.golangci.yaml`).

## Architecture

```

  repl/       → Binlog replication client (acts as MySQL replica)
  copier/     → Parallel row copying (unbuffered and buffered algorithms)
  applier/    → Write layer for target tables (single-target and sharded)
  table/      → Chunking strategies (optimistic, composite, multi)
  checksum/   → Post-copy data verification (CRC32 + BIT_XOR)
  dbconn/     → MySQL connection management, TLS, retries, locking, kill logic
  statement/  → SQL parsing via TiDB parser (ALTER, CREATE, DROP, RENAME)

```

### Data flow (schema change lifecycle)

1. **Attempt Instant/Inplace DDL** — if the change is metadata-only, apply directly
2. **Create shadow table** (`_<table>_new`) with the altered schema
3. **Start replication client** — subscribe to binlog events for the source table
4. **Copy rows** — parallel chunked copying from source to shadow table
5. **Checksum** — verify data consistency between source and shadow
6. **Cutover** — atomic `RENAME TABLE` swap (source ↔ shadow)

### Key design decisions

- **Dynamic chunking**: chunk size is specified as a *target time* (default 500ms), not a row count. The chunk size auto-adjusts based on the 90th percentile of the last 10 chunks.
- **Change row map**: binlog changes are deduplicated in a map before flushing, so a row updated 10 times is only copied once.
- **High watermark optimization**: binlog changes above the copier's current position are discarded (only for auto-increment PKs).
- **Checkpoint/resume**: progress is saved periodically; interrupted migrations resume automatically with ~1 minute of lost progress.

## Package Details

Each package has its own `README.md` with detailed documentation. Key packages to understand:

### `pkg/migration`
The main orchestrator. `runner.go` contains the core migration loop. `Migration` struct is the Kong CLI binding. The `Run()` method drives the full lifecycle. See `cutover.go` for the atomic rename logic.

### `pkg/repl`
Acts as a MySQL replica using [go-mysql](https://github.com/go-mysql-org/go-mysql). Three subscription types:
- **DeltaMap** (preferred) — deduplicates changes in a map; requires memory-comparable PKs
- **DeltaQueue** (fallback) — FIFO queue for non-memory-comparable PKs
- **BufferedMap** (experimental) — stores full row data for cross-server moves

### `pkg/copier`
Two algorithms:
- **Unbuffered** (default) — `INSERT IGNORE INTO ... SELECT` directly in MySQL
- **Buffered** (experimental) — producer/consumer pattern for cross-server migrations

### `pkg/table`
Three chunker implementations:
- **OptimisticChunker** — for `AUTO_INCREMENT` single-column PKs (fast path)
- **CompositeChunker** — for composite or non-auto-increment PKs
- **MultiChunker** — wraps multiple child chunkers for multi-table operations

### `pkg/statement`
Uses the [TiDB parser](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/tree/master/pkg/parser) for SQL parsing. If a DDL cannot be parsed by TiDB, Spirit cannot execute it. `parse_create_table.go` provides structured `CREATE TABLE` parsing.

### `pkg/lint`
12 built-in linters that auto-register via `init()`. Each linter is in its own file (`lint_<name>.go`). To add a new linter, create a new file following the existing pattern and implement the `Linter` interface from `linter.go`.

### `pkg/dbconn`
Handles connection management including:
- Retry logic for transient errors (`RetryableTransaction`)
- TLS auto-configuration (including RDS CA auto-detection)
- Advisory locking (`GET_LOCK`) and table locking (`LOCK TABLES`)
- Force-kill mechanism via `performance_schema` to unblock metadata locks

## Contributing Philosophy

**Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making changes.**

Key principles:
- **Safety over speed**: Consequences of bugs are serious (data loss in financial systems). Features must be *safe* and *designed to be enabled by default*.
- **Decisions, not options**: Non-default configuration options are poorly tested. Prefer sensible defaults over configuration knobs.
- **Conservative feature additions**: Features outside the core use case (AWS, MySQL 8.0/Aurora, InnoDB, no read-replicas) may not be accepted.
- **Tests are mandatory**: All PRs must include tests. Integration tests against real MySQL are the norm.

## Unsupported Features (Do Not Implement)

- **RENAME column** (except via INSTANT DDL) — too risky for data corruption
- **ALTER/DROP PRIMARY KEY** — primary key must remain unchanged
- **Lossy conversions** (e.g., shortening VARCHAR below max data length)
- **FOREIGN KEYS or TRIGGERS** on migrated tables
- **Read-replica fidelity** (<10s lag guarantees)

## Common Patterns

### Adding a new linter
1. Create `pkg/lint/lint_<name>.go` implementing the `Linter` interface
2. Register it in an `init()` function using `RegisterLinter()`
3. Create `pkg/lint/lint_<name>_test.go` with comprehensive test cases
4. Follow the pattern of existing linters (e.g., `lint_has_fk.go`)

### Working with the TiDB parser
All SQL parsing goes through `pkg/statement/`. Do not parse SQL manually. The `Statement` type wraps parsed DDL and provides safety analysis methods.

### Database connections
Always use `pkg/dbconn` for MySQL connections. Never create raw `sql.Open()` calls in production code (test utilities are the exception). The `DBConn` type handles retries, TLS, and connection pooling.

### Error handling
Spirit is designed to fail safely. When in doubt:
- Return an error rather than silently continuing
- The checksum phase catches data inconsistencies — never skip it
- Prefer `assert.NoError(t, err)` in tests (from `testify`)
