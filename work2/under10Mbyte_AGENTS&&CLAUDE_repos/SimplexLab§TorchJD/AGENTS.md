- Only generate docstrings for public functions or functions that contain more than 4 lines of code.
- Use the Sphinx style for Python docstrings (e.g. :param my_param: Does something) and never
  include a :returns: key.
- The code you generate should always contain type hints in the function prototypes (including
  return type hints of None), but type hints are not needed when initializing variables.
- We use uv for everything (e.g. we do `uv run python ...` to run some python code, and
  `uv run pytest tests/unit` to run unit tests). Please prefer `uv run python -c ...` over
  `python3 -c ...`.
- To test the usage examples, run `uv run make doctest -C docs`.
- After generating code, please run `uv run ty check`, `uv run ruff check` and `uv run ruff format`.
  Fix any error.
- After changing anything in `src` or in `tests/unit`, please identify the affected test files in
  `tests/` and run them with e.g. `uv run pytest tests/unit/aggregation/test_upgrad.py -W error`.
  Fix any error, either in the changes you've made or by adapting the tests to the new
  specifications.
- If you create new user-facing content, add a `.rst` file in `docs/source` and link to it
  appropriately.
- If you make any change that affects the documentation (e.g. docstring or `.rst` files), verify
  that the documentation can be built by running
  `uv run make clean -C docs; uv run make html -C docs`.
- Prefix protected functions and modules with '_'.
- Always follow SOLID principles when implementing stuff, and in particular the single
  responsibility principle and the Liskov substitution principle.
