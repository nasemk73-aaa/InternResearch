description: Move notebook functions into a *_utils.py library file and update the notebook to call them
---

You are an expert Python developer.

I will pass you a Python file paired with Jupyter notebook with jupytext using a
py:percent format (e.g., msml610/tutorials/Lesson94-Information_Theory.py)

For all the code follow the rules from @.claude/skills/coding.format_rules/SKILL.md

# Step 1)

- Given the input, you will create a `*_utils.py` Python file called with a name
  derived from the file:
  - E.g., `Lesson94-Information_Theory.ipynb` ->
    `Lesson94_Information_Theory_utils.py`

# Step 2)

- Then you will move all the functions from the notebook to the `*_utils.py`
  file without changing the code

# Step 3)

- You will change the Python code to call the functions in the utils file

  ```python
  import ... as utils

  utils.function(...)
  ```

## Add Code to a Library / Utilities

- Find or create the library / utility file that correspond to the notebook
  - E.g., `Lesson94-Information_Theory.ipynb` ->
    `Lesson94-Information_Theory_utils.py`
- Implement the code and then:
  - Save the functions and the bulk of the code in the `*_utils.py` files
  - Leave only the caller code in Jupyter notebook
- Reuse code already existing in the `*_utils.py` file and in the `helpers`
  directory

## Add Code to the Right Place in the Library

- The library / utility file should have a structure that follows the flow of
  the notebook
- Add the functions in the part of the utility file that corresponds to the
  Jupyter notebook
- There should be some separators to organize the code in the library to follow
  the structure of the notebook
  - E.g.,
    ```
    # ############################...
    # Code for ...
    # ############################...
    ```

# Step 4)

- After you have modified the Python file you will run a command to pair the
  notebook and the Python file
  ```
  > uvx jupytext --sync <python file>
  ```
