description: Refactor unit test files by aligning strings, renaming methods, and factoring out common test code
---

- When I pass you a test file apply the following transformations to the code,
  making sure that there is no change in behavior.

## Align Strings to the Code

- Instead of this

  ```python
    def hello()
      ...
      content = """<start:file1.txt>
  Content for file1
  <start:file2.txt>
  Content for file2
  """
  ```

  align the content of the string to the rest of the code

  ```python
    def hello()
      ...
      content = """
      <start:file1.txt>
      Content for file1
      <start:file2.txt>
      Content for file2
      """
      content = hprint.dedent(content)
  ```

## Rename the Test Methods as `test1`, `test2`, ...

## Factor Out Common Coded

- Aggressively factor out common code in helper code so that each test method
  sets the inputs and the expected value and then calls the helper function with
  the common code

- Instead of:

  ```python
  def test_first_line(self) -> None:
      """
      Test position in first line returns line 1.
      """
      # Prepare inputs.
      content = "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
      position = 3
      # Run test.
      actual = dshctsifi._get_line_number(content, position)
      # Check outputs.
      expected = 1
      self.assertEqual(actual, expected)

  def test_second_line(self) -> None:
      """
      Test position in second line returns line 2.
      """
      # Prepare inputs.
      content = "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
      position = 10
      # Run test.
      actual = dshctsifi._get_line_number(content, position)
      # Check outputs.
      expected = 2
      self.assertEqual(actual, expected)
  ```

- Do

  ```python
  def helper(self, content: str, position: int, expected: int) -> None:
      # Run test.
      actual = dshctsifi._get_line_number(content, position)
      # Check outputs.
      self.assertEqual(actual, expected)

  def test1(self) -> None:
      """
      Test position in first line returns line 1.
      """
      # Prepare inputs.
      content = "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
      position = 3
      expected = 1
      # Run test.
      self.helper(content, position, expected)

  def test2(self) -> None:
      """
      Test position in second line returns line 2.
      """
      # Prepare inputs.
      content = "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
      position = 10
      expected = 2
      # Run test.
      self.helper(content, position, expected)
  ```

## Avoid Replicated Assignment

- If a variable `var` and `expected` need to always be the same (e.g., to show
  that a variable doesn't change), instead of replicating the assignment, do an
  assignment
  ```python
  expected = var
  ```
  - **Bad**
    ```python
    def test2(self) -> None:
        """
        Test indented code block with correct indentation.
        """
        # Prepare inputs.
        txt = """
        - Delete unused reference files
          ```bash
          > rm Dockerfile.ubuntu
          ```
        """
        # Expected: no changes needed.
        expected = """
        - Delete unused reference files
          ```bash
          > rm Dockerfile.ubuntu
          ```
        """
        # Run test.
        self.helper(txt, expected)
    ```
  - **Good**
    ```python
    def test2(self) -> None:
        """
        Test indented code block with correct indentation.
        """
        # Prepare inputs.
        txt = """
        - Delete unused reference files
          ```bash
          > rm Dockerfile.ubuntu
          ```
        """
        # Expected: no changes needed.
        expected = txt
        # Run test.
        self.helper(txt, expected)
    ```
