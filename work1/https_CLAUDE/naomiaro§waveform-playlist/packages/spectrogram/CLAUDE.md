# Spectrogram Package (`@waveform-playlist/spectrogram`)

## Integration Context Pattern

**Pattern:** Browser package defines an interface + context, this package provides implementation via a Provider component. Same pattern as `@waveform-playlist/annotations`.

**Flow:** Browser defines `SpectrogramIntegrationContext` → this package creates `SpectrogramProvider` that supplies components/functions → browser components use `useSpectrogramIntegration()` and gracefully return `null` if unavailable.

**Throwing Context Hooks (Kent C. Dodds Pattern):**
`useSpectrogramIntegration()` throws if used without the provider. This follows the [Kent C. Dodds context pattern](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively) — fail fast with a clear error instead of silently rendering nothing.

```typescript
// Components that need spectrograms — throws if <SpectrogramProvider> missing
const integration = useSpectrogramIntegration();

// Internal components that render with or without spectrograms
// use useContext(SpectrogramIntegrationContext) directly to get null when absent
const spectrogram = useContext(SpectrogramIntegrationContext);
```

## SpectrogramChannel Index vs ChannelIndex

**`SpectrogramChannel`** has two index concerns: `index` (CSS positioning via Wrapper `top` offset) and `channelIndex` (canvas ID construction for worker registration, e.g. `clipId-ch{channelIndex}-chunk0`). In "both" mode, `SmartChannel` passes `index={props.index * 2}` for layout interleaving but `channelIndex={props.index}` for correct canvas identity. When `channelIndex` is omitted it defaults to `index`. Never use the visual `index` for canvas IDs — the worker and SpectrogramProvider registry expect sequential audio channel indices (0, 1).

## Worker Pool Architecture

**Decision:** `createSpectrogramWorkerPool` creates N workers (default 2, one per stereo channel) for parallel per-channel FFT. Configurable via `<SpectrogramProvider workerPoolSize={N}>` for multi-channel audio.

**How it works:** Each worker computes a single channel via `channelFilter` param. Pool routes canvases by channel parsed from canvas ID (`clipId-ch0-chunk5` → worker 0). `renderChunks({channelIndex: N})` remaps to `channelIndex: 0` at the target worker since each worker stores its channel at index 0. Audio data registered in ALL workers (needed for mono mode).

**Mono mode:** Only worker 0 runs (no channelFilter), averages all channels as before.

**Channel cap:** `computeFFT` fan-out is capped to `min(poolSize, channelDataArrays.length)`. If `workerPoolSize` exceeds the channel count (e.g., 3 workers for stereo audio), excess workers sit completely idle (canvas routing also maps by channel, not pool size).

## Generation-Based Abort

**Problem:** During scrolling, stale FFT requests (~1.4s each) block the worker queue, delaying visible-range FFT for the new scroll position.

**Fix:** Cooperative abort via `setTimeout(0)` yielding every 2000 FFT frames. Main thread sends `abort-generation` messages; worker checks `latestGeneration` between yields and returns `null` if stale. Provider catches `SpectrogramAbortError` (via `instanceof`, not string matching) silently.

**Key fields:** `generation` on `ComputeFFTRequest`/`RenderChunksRequest`, `AbortGenerationMessage`, `latestGeneration` in worker.

## Lazy Per-Batch FFT (OOM Prevention)

**Decision:** Never compute a full-clip FFT. Compute FFT per rendering batch (visible range, then contiguous background groups).

**Why:** Full-clip FFT on 1hr+ files allocates ~2.5GB (310K frames × 2048 bins × 4 bytes). Per-batch FFT bounds memory to the chunk range being rendered.

**Implementation:** `computeFFTForChunks()` computes sample range from chunk positions, padded by windowSize. Worker LRU cache (16 entries) prevents recomputation on scroll-back.

## Overscan Buffer (1.5x Viewport)

**Critical:** `getVisibleChunkRange` in SpectrogramProvider MUST use the same 1.5× viewport-width buffer as `useVisibleChunkIndices` in ScrollViewport.tsx. Without this, canvases mounted in the buffer zone (by the virtualizer) remain black — they're classified as "remaining" and get aborted during scrolling before background batches render them.

## Three-Tier Rendering Pipeline

**Decision:** Classify chunks into viewport/buffer/remaining instead of binary visible/remaining.

**Why:** The virtualizer only mounts chunks within the 1.5× buffer. A binary split with a 1.5× buffer classifies ALL mounted chunks as "visible", making phase 1 FFT cover 5-6 chunks (~4.5s) instead of 2 viewport chunks (~1.5s).

**Tiers:**
- **Phase 1a (viewport):** Chunks intersecting exact scroll viewport — fast first paint (~1.5s cold, ~80ms cached)
- **Phase 1b (buffer):** Chunks in 1.5× overscan but outside viewport — prevents black chunks on scroll
- **Phase 2 (remaining):** Off-screen chunks via `requestIdleCallback` background batches

**Contiguous grouping (critical):** Buffer indices may map to non-contiguous chunk numbers (e.g., indices `[0,3,4,5]` → chunks `[10,14,15,11]`). Always use `groupContiguousIndices()` before `computeFFTForChunks()` — without it, min-to-max spanning computes a huge FFT range (96K frames / 4.5s instead of 16K / 700ms per group).

## Controls Outside Scroll Container

**Gotcha:** `scrollContainerRef` coordinates do NOT include `controlWidth`. Controls render in a fixed `ControlsColumn` outside the scroll area. Never add `controlWidth` to chunk pixel positions in `getVisibleChunkRange` or viewport calculations.
