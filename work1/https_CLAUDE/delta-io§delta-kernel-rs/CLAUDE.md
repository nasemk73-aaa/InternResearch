## Project Overview

Delta-kernel-rs is a Rust library for building Delta Lake connectors. It encapsulates the
Delta protocol so connectors can read and write Delta tables without understanding protocol
internals. Kernel never does I/O directly -- it defines _what_ to do via its APIs
(`Snapshot`, `Scan`, `Transaction`) and delegates _how_ to the `Engine` trait.

Current capabilities: table reads with predicates, data skipping, deletion vectors, change
data feed, checkpoints (V1 & V2), log compaction, blind append writes, table creation
(including clustered tables), and catalog-managed table support.

## Build & Test Commands

### Feature Flags

- `default-engine` / `default-engine-rustls` / `default-engine-native-tls` -- async
  Arrow/Tokio engine (pick one TLS backend)
- `arrow`, `arrow-XX`, `arrow-YY` -- Arrow version selection (kernel tracks the latest two
  major Arrow releases; `arrow` defaults to latest). Kernel itself does not depend on Arrow,
  but default-engine does.
- `arrow-conversion`, `arrow-expression` -- Arrow interop (auto-enabled by default engine)
- `prettyprint` -- enables Arrow pretty-print helpers (primarily test/example oriented)
- `catalog-managed` -- catalog-managed table support (experimental)
- `clustered-table` -- clustered table write support (experimental)
- `internal-api` -- unstable APIs like `parallel_scan_metadata`. Items are marked with the
  `#[internal_api]` proc macro attribute.
- `test-utils`, `integration-test` -- development only (`test-utils` enables `prettyprint`)

## Architecture at a Glance

**Snapshot** is the entry point for everything -- an immutable view of a table at a specific
version. From it you build a `Scan` (reads) or `Transaction` (writes).

**Read path:** `Snapshot` -> `ScanBuilder` -> `Scan` -> data. Three execution paths:
`execute()` (simple), `scan_metadata()` (advanced/distributed),
`parallel_scan_metadata()` (two-phase distributed log replay).

**Write path:** `Snapshot` -> `Transaction` -> `commit()`. Kernel provides `WriteContext`,
assembles commit actions, enforces protocol compliance, delegates atomic commit to a
`Committer`.

**Engine trait:** five handlers (`StorageHandler`, `JsonHandler`, `ParquetHandler`,
`EvaluationHandler`, optional `MetricsReporter`). `DefaultEngine` lives in
`kernel/src/engine/default/`.

**EngineData:** opaque columnar data interface. IMPORTANT: never access `EngineData` columns
directly -- always use the visitor pattern (`visit_rows` with typed `GetData` accessors).

## Testing

- **Unit tests** test internal APIs and module internals. It is fine to use public APIs
  like `create_table` in a unit test as setup (e.g. to create a table for testing reads,
  writes, or state loading).
- **Integration tests** exercise only public APIs end-to-end. See `kernel/tests/README.md`
  for a catalog of available test tables (schema, protocol, features, and which tests use
  them). Consult it before creating new test data to avoid duplication.
- Consider how the feature interacts with Delta table features (see Protocol TLDR below).
- Consider write paths: normal commits, checkpointing, CRC files, log compaction files.
- Consider read paths: loading a snapshot from scratch at latest version, at a specific
  version (time travel), and updating from an existing snapshot.
- Consider table state: only deltas (`00.json` to `0N.json`), after a checkpoint, after
  a CRC (`0N.crc`) file, after log compaction, etc.
- Prefer descriptive test names over doc comments. Encode the scenario and expected
  behavior in the test name. Only add a test doc comment when the intent is too
  verbose or complex to express succinctly in the name.
- Use `rstest` to parameterize tests that share the same logic but differ in setup
  or inputs. Prefer `#[case]` over duplicating test functions. When parameters are
  independent and form a cartesian product, prefer `#[values]` over enumerating
  every combination with `#[case]`.
- Reuse helpers from `test_utils` instead of writing custom ones when possible.
- **`add_commit` and table setup in tests:** `add_commit` takes a `table_root` string and
  resolves it to an absolute object-store path. The `table_root` must be a proper URL string
  with a trailing slash (e.g. `"memory:///"`, `"file:///tmp/my_table/"`). Avoid using the
  `Url` type directly -- most test helpers and kernel APIs accept `impl AsRef<str>`, so pass
  URL strings instead. When using local storage, use an un-prefixed store
  (`LocalFileSystem::new()`) with a `file:///` URL string. Do NOT use
  `LocalFileSystem::new_with_prefix()` with `add_commit` -- the prefix causes double-nesting
  because `add_commit` already resolves the full path from the URL. For in-memory tests, use
  `InMemory::new()` with `"memory:///"`. Always use the same `table_root` URL string for
  both `add_commit` (writing log files) and `snapshot`/`Snapshot::try_new` (reading the
  table). Always include a trailing slash in directory URLs to ensure correct path joining.

## Protocol TLDR

The [Delta protocol spec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/delta-io/delta/master/PROTOCOL.md)
is the source of truth. Key concepts:

- **Actions** -- atomic units of a transaction: Metadata, Add File, Remove File, Add CDC
  File, Protocol, CommitInfo, Domain Metadata, Sidecar, Checkpoint Metadata
- **Log structure** -- JSON commit files, checkpoints (V1 parquet, V2 multi-part), log
  compaction files, version checksum (CRC) files, `_last_checkpoint`
- **Protocol versioning** -- (readerVersion, writerVersion) pair. At (3, 7) switches to
  explicit table features via `readerFeatures`/`writerFeatures` arrays. Features cannot be
  removed once added.
- **Data skipping** -- per-file column statistics (min, max, null count, row count) with
  tight/wide bounds
- **Schemas** -- JSON serialization format for StructType/StructField/DataType
- **Stats and partition values** -- per-file column statistics (min, max, nullCount) and
  partition values are stored as JSON strings in Add file actions. The stats JSON structure
  mirrors the table schema. See the protocol spec sections on "Per-file Statistics" and
  "Partition Value Serialization" for the exact formats.

**Table features**:

- Writer: `appendOnly`, `invariants`, `checkConstraints`, `generatedColumns`,
  `allowColumnDefaults`, `changeDataFeed`, `identityColumns`, `rowTracking`,
  `domainMetadata`, `icebergCompatV1`, `icebergCompatV2`, `clustering`,
  `inCommitTimestamp`
- Reader + writer: `columnMapping`, `deletionVectors`, `timestampNtz`,
  `v2Checkpoint`, `vacuumProtocolCheck`, `variantType`, `variantType-preview`,
  `typeWidening`

Keep this list updated when new protocol features are added to kernel.

## Common Gotchas

- **EngineData is opaque:** Never downcast to `ArrowEngineData` or any concrete type
  in production code (ok in tests). Never assume one batch per file -- always iterate.
- **Column mapping:** Physical column names can differ from logical names. Always use
  the schema from `Snapshot::schema()` for user data columns. Metadata/system schema
  column names (defined by the protocol) are not subject to column mapping.
- **Transforms:** Generic recursive schema and expression transform traits and helpers
  are in `kernel/src/transforms/`.

## Code Style / Documentation

- MUST include doc comments for all public functions, structs, enums, and methods.
- MUST document function parameters, return values, and errors.
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.
- Include examples in doc comments for complex functions only.
- NEVER use emoji or unicode in comments that emulates emoji (e.g. special arrows,
  checkmarks). Use ASCII equivalents (`->`, `=>`, etc.) instead.
- Comments should be concise and non-repetitive -- find the right place to say it once.
- Comments should never include temporal references -- only refer to current code and
  design, not past iterations.
- Doc comments focus on "what" (contract with caller) more than "how" (implementation),
  unless the "how" meaningfully impacts the "what".
- Code comments state intent and explain "why" -- don't restate what the code self-documents.
- Place `use` imports at the top of the file (for non-test code) or at the top of the
  `mod tests` block (for test code) -- never inside function bodies.
- NEVER panic in production code -- use errors instead. Panicking
  (including `unwrap()`, `expect()`, `panic!()`, `unreachable!()`, etc) is acceptable in test code only.

## Pull Requests

**Title:** use conventional commit format, lowercase after prefix, no period at the end.
Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `perf`, `test`, `ci`.
If the pull request contains a breaking change, the type must have a `!` suffix.
Examples: `feat: add checkpoint stream support`, `fix: handle empty log segment`,
`refactor: extract common log replay logic`
Breaking change examples: `feat!: make_physical takes column mapping and sets parquet field ids`,
`chore!: remove the arrow-55 feature`

**Description:** follow the template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. Error on the
side of simplicity -- don't list every change. Focus on key API changes, functionality,
and data flow. Keep it concise.

### CI Jobs and Github Actions

**Supply chain security:** every `cargo` command in CI that resolves dependencies MUST use
`--locked` to enforce the committed `Cargo.lock`. This prevents CI from silently picking up
a newer (potentially compromised) transitive dependency. If `Cargo.lock` is out of sync with
`Cargo.toml`, the build fails immediately, forcing dependency changes to be explicit and
reviewable. See the top-level comment in `build.yml` for full rationale. Commands exempt from
`--locked`: `cargo fmt` (no dep resolution), `cargo msrv verify/show` (wrapper tool),
`cargo miri setup` (tooling setup).

Ensure that when writing any github action you are considering safety including thinking of
and mitigating common attack vectors such expression injection and pull request target attacks.

Example:
```yaml
# The code below is vulnerable to expression injection
run: |
    echo "Comment: ${{ github.event.comment.body }}"

# To mitigate instead use environment variables
env:
    COMMENT_BODY: ${{ github.event.comment.body }}
run: |
    echo "Comment: $COMMENT_BODY"
```

## Deep Context

Read these when relevant to the task at hand:
- `CLAUDE/architecture.md` -- kernel architecture: snapshot loading, read/write paths,
  engine trait system, EngineData, key modules, catalog-managed tables
- Always cross-check protocol behavior against the
  [Delta protocol spec](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/delta-io/delta/master/PROTOCOL.md)

**Keeping docs current:** If you notice anything inaccurate in these docs -- renamed
structs, traits, functions, modules, crates, APIs, stale data flows, wrong file paths --
inform the user so they can be updated. After major changes, update this file,
`CLAUDE/architecture.md`, `ffi/CLAUDE.md`, and any relevant `<crate>/CLAUDE.md` files.
