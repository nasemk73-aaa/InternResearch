# Harper Docs Map for Agents

This repository’s documentation site is powered by Vite + SvelteKit + SveltePress.

Use `packages/web/vite.config.ts` as the source of truth for documentation scope:
- Sidebar and important doc routes are defined in `packages/web/vite.config.ts`.
- Route `/docs/...` maps to `packages/web/src/routes/docs/...`.
- Most docs are in `+page.md`; some are `+page.svelte` or route helpers.

If you're working on the Harper repository itself, please pay special attention to the `contributors/*` pages.
Importantly, all of the tools available in this repository are available via `just`. To learn more, run `just --list`.

## On Writing New Rules

When asked to write a new rule, keep these guidelines in mind:

- The user is almost always expecting you to write it to a file. Which file and where is up to you to find out.
- You should include at least 15 total tests, covering a wide variety of cases. Cover false-positives, false negatives, true positives, and if relevant, true negatives.
- You should run any and all tests to ensure that you do no break existing behavior and that your new rule runs the way you expect.
- If the rule is related to a closed compound noun, see if you can just add an entry to the existing closed compound linter.

Unless you are specifically requested to write the rule in a specific way, choose the language (Rust or Weir) and methodology that fits the task.

ALWAYS run extensive bullet tests with `cargo run --bin harper-cli --release -- lint <TEXT>` to make sure the new rule isn't already covered by Harper.

## Workflow for Writing Weir Rules

1. Draft the core expression
- Encode the match with `expr main` using words, sequences, alternatives, filters, exceptions, POS tags, wildcards, or punctuation.
- Keep the expression minimal but precise; avoid overmatching.
- If a wordlist is needed, include it as its own expression, used with an expression reference.

2. Add rule metadata
- `let message`, `let description`, `let kind`, `let becomes` (and `let strategy` if needed).
- Use `strategy "Exact"` when casing must be normalized; otherwise default behavior or `MatchCase` as appropriate.

3. Add tests (required)
- Include at least 15 tests.
- Tests must cover: true positives, false positives, false negatives, and (if relevant) true negatives.
- Prefer a mix of casing, punctuation, whitespace, and nearby-token variations.

4. Sanity-check edge cases
- Ensure exceptions do not block valid matches.
- Ensure replacements are correct and not destructive.

5. Run the tests.
- Fix any issues that arise.

### Output Format

Write a Weir rule to a new file with a name of your choosing, including `expr main`, `let` fields, and tests. Make sure it has the extension `.weir`.
